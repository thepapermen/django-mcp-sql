# Changelog

All notable changes to `django-mcp-sql` are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

## 0.1.0b4 - 2026-06-15

Documentation-only release (no code changes).

### Fixed

- README "Installation" `MCP_SQL` block used the pre-`PROFILES` flat
  `ALLOWED_MODELS` shape, which fails startup validation
  (`ImproperlyConfigured`). It now uses the required `PROFILES` shape. A new
  test (`tests/test_docs_config.py`) runs every paste-ready `MCP_SQL` block in
  the docs through `validate_mcp_sql_settings`, so the install snippet can't
  drift from the validator again.
- The OAuth and role-setup runbooks described the pre-`PROFILES`
  authorization model (`has_perm("mcp_sql.use_mcp_session")`, flat
  `ALLOWED_MODELS`); they now match the code's `resolve_profile` /
  per-profile-whitelist behaviour, with corrected auth-error strings and
  logout token-scope. MFA (`MFA_CHECKER`) and the runtime session-existence
  gate (`SESSION_MODEL`) are now documented as opt-in rather than default.

### Added

- README "How it compares" section positioning the package against hosted
  natural-language→SQL services and reference/platform MCP servers, plus a
  one-line summary callout near the top.

### Changed

- Removed internal build-phase ("Phase N") references from the shipped docs;
  added a "Roadmap / known gaps" section instead. Reorganized the
  architecture doc (curated-view pattern ahead of the OAuth surface; the
  "Watch out" invariants grouped under per-layer subheadings with a mini-TOC).

## 0.1.0b3 - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `Documentation` entry in `[project.urls]` (pointing at the repo's `docs/`
  tree). Django Packages reads a package's documentation link from PyPI
  `project_urls` (keys `Documentation`/`Docs`/`docs`/`documentation`); without
  this key the grid listing showed no documentation despite the docs shipping
  in the wheel.

## 0.1.0b2 - unreleased

### Added

- The MCP tools now advertise output schemas: `run_query` and
  `describe_table` declare `TypedDict` return types (`FencedQueryResult`,
  `TableDescription | ToolError`), which the MCP SDK turns into each tool's
  output schema — so a connecting client sees the result shape, including
  that `run_query`'s `rows` is a fenced JSON string rather than a row matrix.
- A stricter type-check gate: the high-signal subset of mypy strict
  (`warn_unused_ignores`, `warn_redundant_casts`, `warn_return_any`,
  `disallow_any_generics`, `disallow_incomplete_defs`) is now enabled, with
  the package annotated to satisfy it (full `disallow_untyped_defs` stays
  off). A consumer's type checker now reads more precise inline types — e.g.
  `QueryResult.rows` is `list[list[Cell]]`, the cursor surface is a
  `SQLCursor` protocol, and audit kwargs are a `TypedDict` — instead of
  `object`/`Any`.

### Changed

- New runtime dependency `typing-extensions>=4.12` (already present
  transitively via pydantic): the MCP tool-output `TypedDict`s must be the
  `typing_extensions` variant for pydantic to build their schemas on
  Python < 3.12.

## 0.1.0b1 - unreleased

### Added

- Django 4.2 LTS and Django 6.0 support, alongside the existing 5.2 LTS line
  (`Framework :: Django` 4.2/5.2/6.0). No source changes were needed — the
  package uses no Django-version-specific APIs.
- CI expanded to a ragged Django × Python matrix (4.2, 5.2, 6.0 against their
  respective supported interpreters), plus a pinned leg verifying the package
  on DRF 3.14 + Django 4.2 — i.e. drop-in into an app that already pins an
  older DRF.
- `py.typed` marker (PEP 561): the package now ships its inline type
  annotations, so a consumer's type checker reads `mcp_sql`'s types instead
  of treating it as untyped. A `typecheck` extra (`mypy` + `django-stubs` +
  `djangorestframework-stubs`), a `[tool.mypy]` config, a `make typecheck`
  target, and a CI `typecheck` job keep those annotations honest (the public
  surface is annotated; untyped-def bodies are still checked).

### Changed

- Promoted from alpha to **Beta** (`Development Status :: 4 - Beta`).
- Dependency floor `django>=4.2,<6.1` (was `>=5.2,<6.0`).
- Dependency floor `djangorestframework>=3.14` (was `>=3.15.2`): 3.14 is the
  lowest DRF supported — what a legacy Django 4.2 app already pins — so the
  package drops into such a stack without forcing a DRF upgrade. Support is a
  staircase (5.x needs DRF ≥3.15, 6.0 needs ≥3.17); a greenfield install
  resolves the newest in-range DRF for whatever Django it runs.

## 0.1.0a1 - unreleased

First alpha. The feature set below has been exercised in production as part
of a larger Django CRM; the standalone distribution itself is pre-release.

### Added

- Three MCP tools over Streamable HTTP at `/mcp/sql/`: `list_tables`,
  `describe_table`, `run_query` (single validated SELECT).
- sqlglot-backed AST parser gate: single SELECT-shaped statement, scope-aware
  table whitelist, system-schema and function deny-lists, no
  `SELECT *` (configurable), no writeable CTEs, no OFFSET/FETCH/locking
  reads, no set-returning functions in the projection.
- Read-only executor: dedicated `mcp_readonly` Django DB alias,
  `SET LOCAL ROLE` into a Postgres NOLOGIN role with statement-level guard
  GUCs, most-restrictive-wins row caps with LIMIT N+1 truncation detection,
  per-cell and total byte caps.
- Append-only audit: one `MCPQueryLog` row per `run_query` call (every code
  path) and one `MCPAuthRejectionLog` row per resolved-user auth rejection;
  read-only Django admin browsers plus a per-user usage-summary view.
- OAuth 2.1 surface via django-oauth-toolkit: authorization-code + PKCE
  (S256 only), public client, 6h tokens, no refresh tokens; RFC 7591
  dynamic client registration (loopback-only redirect URIs), RFC 8414 +
  RFC 9728 discovery documents; issuance gate and per-request re-validation
  (active staff + MFA + unambiguous profile + optional session-existence
  check); logout revokes tokens.
- Multi-profile access tiers: N profiles in `MCP_SQL["PROFILES"]`, each its
  own Postgres role, whitelist, Django permission and group;
  explicit-assignment binding (superuser confers nothing); config-derived
  group/permission provisioning via post_migrate; dormant per-profile
  `SESSION_CONTEXT` hook for per-user row scoping recipes.
- Prompt-injection fencing: `run_query` rows/error wrapped in a per-response
  random-UUID `<untrusted-data-…>` fence with a `data_handling` instruction;
  standing security posture delivered via MCP `initialize` instructions.
- Grants tooling: `mcp_sql_grants` (drift check / `--apply`),
  `mcp_sql_role_setup --emit-sql` (N-role bootstrap SQL),
  `mcp_sql_smoke` (session-contract + end-to-end executor smoke),
  `mcp_sql_lint` (column-add review gate); idempotent
  `sql/role_setup.sql` + Docker init wrapper.
- Observability: per-user query-volume tripwires (alert, never block),
  group-add alerts, silent per-IP throttle on bad-token probing and
  anonymous registration.
- Standalone test suite (`tests/settings.py`, stock Django + Postgres) and
  GitHub Actions CI (Python 3.11–3.13 × PostgreSQL 14).
